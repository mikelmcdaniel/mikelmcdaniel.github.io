<p>This post is about solving a very particular and unimportant problem: Given a number, N, efficiently generate the sequence of all the numbers in [0, N) in a "middle order" where each number appears exactly once. The first number in a middle order is N / 2, rounding up or down, and the next numbers would be N / 4 and 3 * N / 4. For example, if N was 16, then a middle order could start as [8, 4, 12, ...] <em>or</em> [8, 12, 4, ...]. Both would be appropriate middle orders.</p>
<h2>Powers of 2</h2>
<p>There's a perfect solution for powers of 2 using O(n) time and O(1) space.</p>

<p>I find it easier to think about the "batches" of ints that are returned. For example, if N = 16, then we want to return [8, 4, 12, 2, 6, 10, 14, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 0] which has these nice batches: [8], [4, 12], [2, 6, 10, 14], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], [0]. With the exception of the trailing 0, each batch follows a nice pattern, starting at some power of 2 like "2" and skipping by twice that amount until it gets to N = 16. [4, 12] starts at 4 and skips by 8, [2, 6, 10, 14] starts at 2 and skips by 4, and so on.</p>
<p>The batches also give a nice way generate <em>all</em> middle orders, simply by rearranging the order of the numbers in each batch.</p>
<h2>Non-Powers-of-2</h2>
<p>So far, the best big-O performance I've gotten for non-powers-of-2 is O(n) time and O(log(n)) space.</p>

# O(n) time and O(n) space
def middle_order_queue(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
  &#34;&#34;&#34;Return all the numbers in [0, n) in middle order using a queue.

  The queue contains a list of ranges, starting with [0, n). For each range, we
  yield the mid-point and add on the left and right subranges of numbers that
  have not been yielded yet.

  This takes O(n) space because the queue size will have roughly n / 2 elements
  at it&#39;s peak size.
  &#34;&#34;&#34;
  # q is a queue of ranges of numbers that have not been yielded yet.
  # The lo(wer) bound is inclusive and the hi(gher) bound is exclusive.
  q = collections.deque([(0, n)])
  # This loop will iterate at most 2 * n times.
  # Each iteration is O(1) time.
  # During the last iterations, q will have O(n / 2) = O(n) pairs in it!
  while q:
    lo, hi = q.popleft()
    if lo == hi:
      continue

def _middle_order_recursive(lo: int, hi: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
  &#34;&#34;&#34;Return all the numbers in [lo, hi) in middle order using recursion.

  First, we yield the mid point of [lo, hi), then we process the mid points of
  [lo, mid) and [mid + 1, hi) in an interleaved.

  This uses O(hi - lo) space because each recursive generator call creates 2
  generators (one for the left half and one for the left half), with a total
  depth of roughly log(hi - lo, 2).
  &#34;&#34;&#34;
  if lo == hi:
    return
  mid = (lo + hi) // 2
  yield mid
  # Note that because we recure on the left and right halves simultaneously,
  # this use O(n) space in the worst case!
  left = _middle_order_recursive(lo, mid)
  right = _middle_order_recursive(mid + 1, hi)
  # Note that since len(list(right)) &lt;= len(list(left)), we must put right
  # in zip first. zip(left, right) would not work because zip would call
  # next(left) first then call next(right) and realize that there were no
  # elements next *and* zip would not return the element from left so we would

  Here, we calculate the smallest power of 2 that is &gt;= n, then call
  middle_order_power_of_2 and use a set to ensure we only yield each number one
  time.

  This takes O(n) space because the set will contain all numbers in [0, n).
  &#34;&#34;&#34;

  n2 = power_of_2_ge(n)

def _middle_order_ranges(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[Tuple[int, int]]:
  &#34;&#34;&#34;Yield all left and right ranges in [0, n) in middle order using recursion.

  This strategy is actually the same as the queue strategy in disguise! Instead
  of maintaining a queue in memory, we use recursion to see what our earlier
  ranges are that we need to process.

  Each range is then processed by yielding the left and right sub-ranges.

  Since we only recurse once *and* only iterate over 1/2 of the numbers in the
  recursive call as what we yield, this function uses O(n + n/2 + n/4 + ...) =
  O(n) time and O(log2(n)) space.

<h2>The Original Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivation for this problem, while real, is unrelated to middle orders.</p>
<p>I was playing with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder">Variational Autoencoder</a> to transition from one image to another. The more intermediate frames there are, the smoother the transition looks but generating intermediate frames is slow. I knew 100 frames would be enough and I also really wanted to see the animation as it was being produced. In this particular setup, I had my script generating images named "000.png", "001.png", ..., "099.png". Generating them in order meant that I couldn't really see the animation until it was complete. However, if I generated image "050.png" first, then "025.png" and "075.png", etc., I could see a rough version of the animation before it was complete! Solving this little problem was fun and got me thinking about how to do it more efficiently, even though I really didn't need to solve it efficiently.</p>
<video width="512" height="512" controls>
 <source src="smooth-transition.mp4" type="video/mp4" loop>
</video>

<p>After implementing an initial <code>middle_order</code> function, I got so distracted, I wrote a few different versions and wrote this little blog post.</p>
<h2>A More General Problem</h2>
<p>I focused specifically on a "middle" order here but that's not the only solution to my 'smooth transition' problem! I wanted to know what order I should generate the images in so that if I stopped generating images at some arbitrary time, I could see a rough version of the animation that was as close to the final smooth version as possible. In other words, a sequence of integers in [0, N) such that if I took the first K numbers, they would be as equally spaced as possible <em>and</em> cover most of the range from 0 to N as possible.</p>
<p>I've I think there's a solution that might involve the constant phi but I wasn't able to get it to work:</p>
<p><a href="phailed_attempt.py">phailed_attempt.py</a><pre><code class="python3">from typing import Iterator

def phi_order(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
  phi = (5**0.5 + 1) / 2
  for i in range(n):
    yield round(i * n * phi) % n

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
  for n in range(1, 30):
    order = list(phi_order(n))
    print(f&#39;{n:2d} {str(sorted(order) == list(range(n))):5s} {order}&#39;)</code></pre>
