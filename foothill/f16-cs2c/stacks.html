<h2>Stacks</h2>
<p>A stack is an ADT (abstract data type) that supports a few operations: push() (like <code class="c++">std::vector::push_back()</code>), pop() (like <code class="c++">std::vector::pop_back()</code>), and top() (like <code class="c++">*std::vector::back()</code>). In practice, most uses of stacks are actually very low level, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">call stack</a> which stores local variables and other information.</p>
<p>If you had to build a "Stack" class, how would you do it? If you used existing classes, which ones would you be able to use?</p>
<p>One use of a stack (as a last-in-first-out or "LIFO" queue) is if you had a situation where you wanted to serve the last customer first. Imagine for example, that you are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22We+always+put+you+first%22+%22Your+satisfaction+is+our+number+one+concern%22">popular internet service company</a> and you have a lot of people that call in for help. You also know that after some unknown amount of time, people on hold get mad. Once they're mad, they stay mad, so it's best to serve people as quickly as possible or just let them be mad for a long time. In this scenario, you might take incoming requests and put them in a stack. When a customer service representative is done with a call, they simply take the call of the top of the stack (the last person who called). This ensures that people's calls are either answered quickly or after a 'long' time.</p>

<h3>Stacks and computer math</h3>
<p>Stacks are also integral to how computers compute mathematical expressions. As people, we usual would write an expression like "1 + 2 * 3 + 4" and compute that 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 == 1 + 6 + 4 == 7 + 4 == 11. Writing a program to evaluate that expression is somewhat challenging if you don't already know the right algorithm. However, it's much easier to write a program that evaulates postfix notation (e.g "1 2 3 * + 4 +"). The rules are simple: When you see a constant/number, put it on a stack. When you see an operator, pull the last two numbers off the stack, computer the result with that operator, then put that result on the stack. After doing this for the entire expression, you'll have the final result.</p>
<p>Here's code for a postfix expression evaluator:</p>
postfix_expression_evaluator.cpp<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;exception&gt;

class EvalPostfixError : public std::exception {
private:
  const char* msg;
public:
  EvalPostfixError(const char* msg) : msg(msg) {}
  virtual const char* what() const throw() {
    return msg;
  }
};

void pop_pair(std::vector&lt;long&gt; *stack, long *a, long *b) {
  if (stack-&gt;size() &lt; 2) {
    throw EvalPostfixError(&#34;Stack has &lt; 2 arguments to pop.&#34;);
  }
  *b = (*stack)[stack-&gt;size() - 1];
  stack-&gt;pop_back();
  *a = (*stack)[stack-&gt;size() - 1];
  stack-&gt;pop_back();
}

long simple_eval_postfix(const std::string&amp; postfix_expression) {
  std::vector&lt;long&gt; stack;
  for (const char c : postfix_expression) {
    // std::clog &lt;&lt; &#34;Stack: &#34;;
    // for (const long&amp; num: stack) {
    //   std::clog &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; &#34; &#34;;
    // }
    // std::clog &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    switch (c) {
      long a, b;
    case &#39;+&#39;:
      pop_pair(&amp;stack, &amp;a, &amp;b);
      stack.push_back(a + b);
      break;
    case &#39;-&#39;:
      pop_pair(&amp;stack, &amp;a, &amp;b);
      stack.push_back(a - b);
      break;
    case &#39;*&#39;:
      pop_pair(&amp;stack, &amp;a, &amp;b);
      stack.push_back(a * b);
      break;
    case &#39;/&#39;:
      pop_pair(&amp;stack, &amp;a, &amp;b);
      stack.push_back(a / b);
      break;
    default:
      if (c &lt; &#39;0&#39; || c &gt; &#39;9&#39;)
        throw EvalPostfixError(&#34;Unexpected char is not an operator or digit.&#34;);
      stack.push_back(c - &#39;0&#39;);
    }
  }
  return stack[stack.size() - 1];
}

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; simple_eval_postfix(&#34;123*+4+&#34;) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  // Process any command line arguments as postfix expressions.
  for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; ++i) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; argv[i] &lt;&lt; &#34; ==&gt; &#34; &lt;&lt; simple_eval_postfix(argv[i]) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
