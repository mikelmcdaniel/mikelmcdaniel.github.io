<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Write a command-line program which takes one command-line argument (<code>argv[1]</code>) and either builds a filter or uses a filter to filter strings. You may use a Bloom Filter or something more creative.</p>
<p>The first time your program is run, it will output a filter to <code>cout</code> which will be copied to a file. The second time your program is run, it will read that filter from a file and use it to filter strings. This is why your filter can have any format you like as long as you can read <em>and</em> write it.</p>

<h3>If your program is not passed any arguments:</h3>
<p>If your program does <em>not</em> contain <code>argv[1]</code>, then read strings from <code>cin</code> and output a filter (or another filter of your choosing) to <code>cout</code>. The filter must not be more than 1 kilobyte in size.</p>

<h3>If your program is passed an argument:</h3>
<p>If your program <em>does</em> contain <code>argv[1]</code>, then read the filter from that file (it will be the same filter your program output from earlier), read strings from <code>cin</code> and output a strings that pass the filter.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre><kbd>$ cat fruits.txt
</kbd><samp>apple
banana
cherry
</samp><kbd>$ ./your_program &lt; fruits.txt &gt; filter.bin
$ ./your_program filter.bin &lt; fruits_and_vegetables.txt
</kbd><samp>apple
banana
cherry
spinach</samp></pre>
<p>The filter above is not perfect and that's ok. Whatever strings are used to build the filter should always pass the filter. Other strings can pass the filter as well, as long as it's not too many. It is impossible to build a perfect filter but a filter that allows all strings would be useless.</p>

<h3>Example Program:</h3>
<pre><code class="c++">// Example filter program for (Bloom) Filter assignment.
// Note that this filter works but the output filter is too big.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

void build_filter(istream&amp; is, set&lt;string&gt;* filter) {
  for (string line; getline(is, line); ) {
    filter-&gt;insert(line);
  }
  if (!is.eof()) {
    throw runtime_error(&#34;Error reading from istream.&#34;);
  }
}

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
  if (argc &gt; 1) { // if I&#39;ve been given a filename
    ifstream filter_file(argv[1]);
    set&lt;string&gt; filter_lines;
    string line;
    // Read in the file to create my filter object
    build_filter(filter_file, &amp;filter_lines);
    // Read lines from std::cin
    //   output the line if it &#34;passes&#34; the filter
    for (string line; getline(cin, line); ) {
      if (filter_lines.find(line) != filter_lines.end()) {
        cout &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; endl;
      }
    }
    if (!cin.eof()) {
      throw runtime_error(&#34;Error reading from std::cin.&#34;);
    }
  } else { // else I&#39;ve NOT been given a filename
    // Create an empty filter
    set&lt;string&gt; filter_lines;
    // Read lines from std::cin and add each line to filter
    build_filter(cin, &amp;filter_lines);
    // Output filter to std::cout
    for (const string&amp; filter_line : filter_lines) {
      cout &lt;&lt; filter_line &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>The program above is almost good enough to pass this assignment. The only problem is that the filter it would output would be too big!</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>When the filter is built, there will be no more than 1,000 input strings. The filter must accept all strings used to build the filter and may not accept more than 80% of the strings <em>not</em> used to build the filter.</p>
