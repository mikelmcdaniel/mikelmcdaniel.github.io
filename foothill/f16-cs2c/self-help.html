<h2>Forums: How to ask questions</h2>
<p>When you have a problem, a lot of people genuinely want to help you learn how to solve your problem.  If you haven't read it already, please read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">"How to ask a good question?"</a> by Stack Overflow so you can help others help you.</p>

<h2>Your URL Bar (a.k.a. Google or Bing)</h2>
<p>Never underestimate the power of literally typing in your question in your browser's URL bar.</p>
<p>If you don't how an algorithm works, like <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bubble+sort">bubble sort</a>, search for it!</p>
<p>If you try to compile some code and get an error message, search for it! (Copy and past the error message.)</p>

<h2>C++</h2>
<p><a href="http://cppreference.com">cppreference.com</a> is a great C++ reference, but it is very technical and is best used for exploring things you've already studied, like <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/push_back">std::vector::push_back</a>.</p>

<h2>Programming Practice</h2>
<p>If you're looking for general programming practice, there are a lot of free sites out there.  Most of the easy-to-use ones don't require you to submit code but ask you to write a program to calculate something, then enter your answer.  Here are a few I recommend:</p>

  <tr> <th>Site</th> <th>Focus</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td><a href="https://coderbyte.com/challenges/#easyChals">Coder Byte</a></td> <td>general algorthms and datastructures problems</td>
  <tr> <td><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup">Hacker Rank</a></td> <td>a wide variety of problems, sponsored by companies</td>
  <tr> <td><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></td> <td>very math (number theory) intensive, starting out easy and getting much harder</td>
  <tr> <td><a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/">Rosaland</a></td> <td>focused on bioinformatics, where biology meets computer science</td>
