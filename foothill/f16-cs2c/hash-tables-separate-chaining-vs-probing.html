<h2>Separate Chaining</h2>
<p>One way to implement hash tables is with separate chaining: where the hash table is just buckets (e.g. a vector) or container (e.g. linked lists). When insert/remove/search are used, you simply hash the key you're looking for, mod it by the number of buckets, then perform the insert/remove/search on that container/bucket.</p>
<h3>Example Code:</h3>
<pre><code class="c++">#pragma once

#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;forward_list&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
class SimpleHashTable {
  const double MAX_LOAD_FACTOR = 2.0;

  std::vector&lt;std::forward_list&lt;T&gt; &gt; buckets;
  int size;

  std::forward_list&lt;T&gt;&amp; get_bucket(const T&amp; value) {
    return buckets[std::hash&lt;T&gt;{}(value) % buckets.size()];
  }

public:

  // Initialize the vector to have num_buckets... buckets
  SimpleHashTable(int num_buckets=1) : buckets(num_buckets), size(0) {}

  void insert(const T&amp; value) {
    if (load_factor() &gt;= MAX_LOAD_FACTOR) {
      resize(buckets.size() * 2);
    }
    ++size;
    get_bucket(value).push_front(value);
  }
  bool contains(const T&amp; value) const {
    std::forward_list&lt;T&gt;&amp; bucket = get_bucket(value);
    auto it = std::find(bucket.begin(), bucket.end(), value);
    return it != bucket.end();
  }
  void remove(const T&amp; value) {
    --size;
    get_bucket(value).remove(value);
  }

  double load_factor() const {
    return static_cast&lt;double&gt;(size) / buckets.size();
  }

  void resize(int new_num_buckets) {
    // make hash table with new_num_buckets
    SimpleHashTable&lt;T&gt; new_table(new_num_buckets);
    // copy values to new hash table
    for (const std::forward_list&lt;T&gt;&amp; bucket : buckets) {
      for (const T&amp; value : bucket) {
        new_table.insert(value);
      }
    }
    // swap hash tables
    std::swap(*this, new_table);
    // delete old hash table
  }
};</code></pre>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Open_addressing">Probing (a.k.a Open Addressing)</a></h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Probing/Open addressing works by having buckets that can only contain one element. When doing an insert, you hash the key to find the bucket you want to insert in. If the bucket is full, then you 'probe' until you find an empty bucket and insert there. Searching is done similarly, you hash to find the first bucket, then keep probing until you either find the key or find an empty slot (at which point, you know the key isn't in the hash table). Removes are possible, but tricky. The naive approach is to search for the key you want to remove and remove it, but then you'd have an empty bucket and it may become impossible to find items you've already inserted.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">Linear Probing</a></h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Hash_table_5_0_1_1_1_1_0_SP.svg" alt="A hash table demonstrating how a collision is resolved with linear probing.">
<p>In the simplest case, linear probing is when you check the next bucket when there's a collision. In other words, if I insert A into a hash table at bucket 0, then insert B, which also hashes to 0, then I'd check if bucket 0+1 is empty. If it is, I insert B in bucket 1, otherwise I check bucket 2, then 3, etc. Searching for an element is done similarly.</p>
<p>In the general case, instead of probing 1 bucket ahead, you probe K buckets ahead (where K is a non-zero integer). For example, if K == 2 and you have a collision at bucket 3, then you'd check buckets 5, 7, 9, etc. until you found an empty bucket.</p>
<p>Note that if the hash function doesn't uniformly distribute keys across the buckets, then linear probing (and some other probing schemes) will cause you to insert keys in big clusters, while leaving other parts of the hash table empty. In essence, it completely destroys the nice average running time for insert and search.</p>

<h3>Why there are a prime number of buckets</h3>
<p>Linear probing (and most other probing schemes) have one huge flaw: they might not actually check every bucket. For example, if I have a hash table with 16 buckets and I use linear probing to probe every K == 4 buckets, then if I have a collision at bucket 0, I'd only probe buckets 0, 4, 8, and 12, which is only 1/4 of the total number of buckets! This is why the number of buckets in a hash table is often a prime number. As long as K and the number of buckets are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers">coprime</a> (e.g. 6 and 35 or 2 and 9) then you can guarantee that every bucket would be probed. If the number of buckets is a prime number, then you can guarantee that any K, where K != num_buckets, will be coprime with the number of buckets.</p>
<p>Another reason, whether you're using open addressing/probing or separate chaining, is that some hash functions aren't very good and having a prime number of buckets ends up making those hash functions distribute keys more uniformly.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing">Quadratic Probing</a></h3>
<p>Quadratic probing is just like linear probing, except instead of jumping by K every time, you jump by K1 * i + K2 * i * i where K1 and K2 are constants and i is the current probe number. For example, if you hashed a key to bucket 3 and K1 == 0, K2 == 1, then you'd check buckets 3, 3+1, 3+4, 3+9, etc.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hashing">Double Hashing</a></h3>
<p>Double hashing is like linear probing except instead of jumping by K every time, you jump by i * hash_2(key). In other words, you use a second hash function to get an integer and you jump by that much instead of by a constant K. For example, if my_key hashed to bucket 1 and hash_2(my_key) == 3, then I'd probe buckets 1, 1+3, 1+2*3, 1+3*3, etc.</p>
