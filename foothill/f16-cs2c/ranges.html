<h2>Ranges of Integers</h2>
<p>Ranges of integers are often presented as [lower_bound, upper_bound), which is all integers from lower_bound to upper_bound, not including upper_bound. For example, the range [0, 5) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The range [3, 3) is ... nothing!</p>
<p>It's really important to keep this in mind, especially when writing algorithms like Binary Search. In Binary Search, you calculate a middle index like <code class="c++">int middle = lower_bound + (upper_bound - lower_bound) / 2;</code> then check the middle index and potentially recurse the left or right of that index. In the case of Binary Search, you want to make sure you don't include the middle index when you recurse, so if you recurse to the left you should recurse on the range [lower_bound, middle) and if you're recursing to the right you should recurse on [middle + 1, upper_bound).</p>
<p>This is the standard way to express ranges, but even if it wasn't, I argue it has several small advantages. In particular, it makes a lot of modular arithmetic easier. If I have a number and I want to force it in the correct range, I could write code like <code class="c++">index = lower_bound + (index % (upper_bound - lower_bound))</code>. It also makes for-loops a bit easier: <code class="c++">for(int i = lower_bound; i &lt; upper_bound; ++i) { ... }</code>. There's certainly nothing that forces you or most people to use this convention, much like how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array)">not all programming languages use 0-based indices</a>.</p>
