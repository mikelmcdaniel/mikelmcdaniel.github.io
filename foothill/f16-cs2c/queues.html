<h3>Queues</h3>
<p>A queue is an ADT (abstract data type) that supports a couple operations: enqueue() (like <code class="c++">std::list::push_back()</code>) and dequeue() (like <code class="c++">std::list::pop_front()</code>). These operations might also be called things like push and pop. The important part of a queue is that it behaves similar to a queue or a line in real life. The person in the queue/line at a restuarant is going to be the first person who gets served. Queues show up a lot in big computer systems too. For example, when many people request a web page at the same time, they're put into a queue and the web server will process their requests one at a time. They're also used as a way for different threads, processes, or computers to send messages to each other. One thing puts a message in a queue and the other reads from it.</p>
<p>Other than a linked-list (like the <code class="c++">std::list</code>), how else might you create a Queue class, if you needed to?</p>
