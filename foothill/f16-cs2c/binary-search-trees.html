<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">Binary Search Trees</a></h2>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>A binary search tree is tree data structure composed of nodes. Each node has a value associated with it may or may not have a left child (which is a node) and may or may not have a right child. For a parent node, all the values of all the nodes in the left child must be less than the value of the parent node. Similarly, all the values of all the node sin the right child must be greater than the value of the parent node.</p>

<h3>Inserting</h3>
<h4>Empty <abbr title="Binary Search Tree">BST</abbr><h4>
<p>If the tree is empty, then all you have to do is create the first node!</p>
<h4><abbr title="Binary Search Tree">BST</abbr> with 1 node</h4>
<p>If there's only one node, then you just have to decide if the value should be in a node as the left or right child. If the value you're inserting is less than the value of that one node, then it should be the left child, otherwise it should be inserted as the right child.</p>
<h4>All other BSTs</h4>
<p>The same logic for a single node BST also applies to the general case. All you have to do is look at a node and decide whether to insert somewhere in the left or right subtree. Eventually, you'll follow the children nodes until you get to a node that doesn't have a left/right child and simply insert the new value/node there.</p>
<h3>Finding</h3>
<p>To find a node, you start at the root (top most node) of the tree, then ask yourself: Is the value we' looking for equal to the value at this node? If it is, then you're done! If not, then check if it's the value you're looking for is less than the value at that node. If it's less, then the value must be somewhere in the left subtree, otherwise it must be somewhere in the right subtree. In either case, after going to the left or right child, you simply repeat the process until you get to a <code>nullptr</code> node or you find the element.</p>
<p>Try inserting <strong>9, 5, and 15</strong> into the binary search tree above.</p>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree#Deletion">Removing</a></h3>
<h4>BST with 1 node</h4>
<p>Removing in this case is easy... just remove that node.</p>
<h4>BST with 1 node parent</h4>
<p>If the node you're removing is one of the leaf nodes (a node without children), then all you have to do is remove it (usually that means calling <code>delete</code>) and update the parent so that it's not pointing that the removed node. However, if you're removing the one parent node, then you have to replace it with one of the children. Basically, this just means choosing one of the children, moving it, and making it point to the other child. So, if we had a small tree like 1 &larr; 2 &rarr; 3, and we removed 2, we could end up with either 1 &rarr; 3 or 1 &larr; 3 after making 1 or 3 the new parent. Either of the new trees is valid because all nodes to the left are 'less than' and all nodes to the right are 'greater than' the parent node.</p>
<h4>All other BSTs</h4>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Binary_search_tree.svg" alt="An example binary search tree with some positive integers.">
<p>Let's consider the bigger BST from above. If we remove a leaf node, it's easy, but what if we need to remove a different node, like ... the root (8)? It needs to be replaced with something and this time if we chose the left or right child, we'd then have to replace the left or right child. If we chose the left child, it wouldn't even be a BST anymore because 4, 6, and 7 would all be greater than 3!</p>
<p>Let's solve one problem at a time, starting with correctness. We can't just choose any node to replace the root, but if we choose either the greatest node in the left subtree or the least node in the right subtree to replace it, then we would still know that all nodes to left of the new root would be less and all the nodes in the right subtree would be greater.</p>
<p>Now, we need to figure out how to replace the node we replace the root with. The good news is that every time we replace a parent node (which is a root of a subtree), we replace it with some node that's closer to the bottom of the tree. So, we can actually apply our algorithm recursively. For example, let's consider replacing the root, 8, from the BST above. We could choose to always replace nodes with the greatest node to the left or the least node to the right. For this example, let's say that we always prefer to take from the least node from the right subtree. OK, so 8 is removed and replaced with 10. Now, we have to remove replace 10. We can replace 10 with 13, then we're done. If we look at just the right half of the tree now, we'd have 10 &rarr; 13 &rarr; 14, which is valid!</p>
<p>Try working through removing the root, 8, always choosing the greatest element to the left. What does the final tree look like?</p>
<h3>Iterating / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">Traversal</a></h3>
<p>Writing an iterator for a Binary Search Tree is difficult. If we want a challenge, try writing one, but otherwise, we'll just focus on traversting a tree, which is where we 'visit' each node.</p>
<p>Imagine that we had a BST and we wanted to print out all of the keys/values in sorted order. Printing an empty tree (<code>nullptr</code> root) is easy: We just do nothing because there's nothing to print. Printing the key/value from a single node is similarly easy:  We <code>std::cout</code> the node's key and value, but what about an entire tree? If we start at the root and we want to print the nodes in order, we can take advantage of everything to the left being less and everything to the right being greater. If we have a function that prints a subtree, then we can print a tree in order by first printing the left subtree (the root of the left subtree is the left child of the root), then print the root's key/value, then print the right subtree. Below is an example:</p>
<h5>binary_search_tree_demo.cpp</h5>
<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include &#34;binary_search_tree.h&#34;

  if (node != nullptr) {
    print_professors_in_order(node-&gt;left);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; node-&gt;key &lt;&lt; &#34; made $&#34; &lt;&lt; node-&gt;value &lt;&lt; &#34; in 2014.\n&#34;;
    print_professors_in_order(node-&gt;right);
  }
}

  std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, std::string&gt; &gt; professors = {
