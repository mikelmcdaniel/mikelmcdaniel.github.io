<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault#Causes">Segmentation Faults</a></h2>
<p>Segmentation faults, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal#SIGSEGV">"SIGSEGV"</a> or "segmentation violation", happen when a program tries to access memory that it's not allowed to. If your program crashes with a segmentation fault, it very likely means that it tried to read an element of an array/vector that was out of bounds (e.g. <code class="c++">myvector[myvector.size()]</code>), that it tried to dereference a null pointer, the program tried to recurse too many times, or it tried to allocate more memory than was available (e.g. <code class="c++">while (true) new int[1000000];</code>).

<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of efficiency that come up in programming: micro-optimization and big-O. Micro-optimization is the science/art of making your code faster by some constant factor. For example: writing a sorting algorithm that switches to bubble sort once the input gets small. Micro-optimization is important in systems that need to be really fast, such as programs used by stock traders where every microsecond counts. However, micro-optimizing usually takes extra time and makes code harder to understand. If you want the code to be more readable, you should not focus on micro-optimizing.</p>
<p>However, when you interview for virtually any software engineering job, you won't be asked about or judged on how well you Micro-optimize because most applications are processing small amounts of data and most applications don't need every microsecond. What they do need is the second kind of Efficiency: big-O, which is change in speed as the input gets larger. So much that is done today processes massive amounts of data. Bubble sort is fast for small inputs, but most of the time you're not processing small inputs and most of the time when you are, the speed doesn't matter because the input is so small that any sane algorithm is correct. Furthermore, readability is important. If making your code faster for some special cases (when those special cases don't make a difference) makes your code harder to read and reason about, that's bad.</p>

<h2>Timing</h2>
<p>Timing how long some code takes can be very tricky. Even when you have a program that should be running the same thing every time and doesn't use threads. One of the biggest causes for unreliable timing comes from how operating systems schedule processes. A computer can only do so many things at once, so when it needs to do more things at once it actually just switches back and forth really fast. This can mean that even though <strong>your</strong> code doesn't behave differently, it can take a different amount of time to run each time because other programs that are running may get scheduled more or less. Other than the operating system, there are lots of other things that can get in the way like reading or writing from the network or to disk or caches.</p>

<h2><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sizeof">sizeof</a></h2>
<p>I've seen at least one person try to use <code>sizeof</code> to get the size of an array and had trouble. Here's how it works! In short <code>sizeof</code> is an operator that returns how many bytes something is, <strong>but</strong> it can only use information that's available at compile time. This means that if you use it on a statically sized array, then it'll compute the total number of bytes need to store all the elements in that array. However, if you use it to get the size of a dynamically sized array <strong>or</strong> a pointer, you'll get the size of the pointer instead of the contents of the array. See the sample code below:</p>
example_sizeof.cpp<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

void sizeof_function(int *array) {
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;sizeof(array)  (in sizeof_function): &#34; &lt;&lt; sizeof(array) &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main() {
  int32_t statically_sized_array[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};  // 7 elements (sizeof(int32_t) * 7 == 28)
  int32_t *dynamically_sized_array = new int32_t[7];  // 7 elements  (sizeof(int32_t *) == 8)
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;sizeof(statically_sized_array): &#34; &lt;&lt; sizeof(statically_sized_array) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;sizeof(int32_t[7]): &#34; &lt;&lt; sizeof(int32_t[7]) &lt;&lt; endl;

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)">Abstraction</a> (a.k.a Generalization)</h2>
<p>Abstraction is really just a nickname for generalization. Numbers are an example of an abstraction. At some point, you learned about numbers. You knew about the number 1 and the number 2. You learned how to get to a "next" number by adding 1. You learned how to add two numbers. However, when you learned about those idea, you probably didn't know the number 0 or negative numbers or fractions or <a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/complex.htm">complex numbers</a>. At some point later, you learned that with a small amount of work, you could apply what you'd learned about natrual numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) to integers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and to fractions and to all sorts of other numbers. Numbers by themselves don't help you much, but knowing that <strong>numbers can represent real concepts</strong> like the number of people alive, or your grade, your salary, your heart rate, your life expectency and knowing how to manipulate numbers, you can take an abstract thing and <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lifetables/national-life-tables/2010---2012/sty-facts-about-le.html">calculate something real or interesting</a>. You can manipulate numbers in basically the same way no matter what they represent.</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">Encapsulation</a></h2>
<p>Encapsulation is a form of abstraction: it's when you hide implementation details. For example: <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/">iterators</a> of a collection (list, vector, set, etc.) behave a lot like pointers to an array. If you have a pointer, <code>p</code>, or an iterator, <code>i</code>, then you can increment either of them (<code>++p</code> or <code>++i</code>). You can compare them to other pointers/iterators. You can get the value it 'points' to (<code>*p</code> or <code>*i</code>). Some iterators, like <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/RandomAccessIterator/">random access iterators</a>, can do more, but even the basic ones that only support <code>++i</code>, <code>*i</code>, and <code>i != i2</code> give you just enough that you can iterate over any iterator in exactly the same way<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming/lecture/EkOmk/google-engineer-spotlight-iterables">.</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/">Iterators</a></h2>
<p>ITerators are a good example of abstraction and encapsulation. In C, it's common to iterate over arrays either with indices (e.g. <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) std::cout &lt;&lt; array[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>) or with pointers (e.g. <code>for (int *p = &amp;array[0], *p_end = &amp;array[10]; p != p_end; ++p) std::cout &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>). So, in C or C++, I could write code that takes a couple of pointers and iterates over them. Iterators behave like pointers, so if I have an begin and end iterator I can write code that iterates over it, much like a pointer. Most importantly, it doesn't matter if I have a begin and end pointer or a begin and end <code>std::vector<T>::iterator</code> or a begin and end iterator of some other type: I can always iterate over them in the same way.</p>

<h2><em>Automated</em> Testing</h2>
<h3>Why it's important</h3>
<p>People don't get things always right the first time, no matter how experienced or amazing they are. When your code is tested, you and everyone else has much higher confidence that it's correct. Some things aren't worth more than manual tests, like simple programs that you only run once, but others are more important.</p>
<!-- http://diatribe.org/issues/57/learning-curve -->
<p>Consider a person with type 1 diabetes. Their pancreas doesn't produce insulin (or at least not enough) so as they eat food (especially sugar) and their body breaks it down into glucose and the glucose goes into their blood, they're unable to convert that glucose to useful energy. Over the past years, there's been research on a <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/bionicpancreas/about-us/the-bionic-pancreas-ilet/">Bionic Pancreas</a>: a blood-glucose sensor hooked up to an insulin pump and some smart software to make sure they get just the right amount of insulin. During a study with children at a summer camp, one child got a lethal dose of insulin because of a software bug. Luckily, their blood-glucose levels were being monitored, so the camp staff was able to shove sugar in her mouth until they stabalized. Imagine what would happen if they didn't test the software and the product was released to the general public? The Bionic Pancreas isn't the only product with these kinds of consequences.</p>
<p>Some things may not be worth testing, but anything that you want to work probably is worth testing. I hope you write software that's worth testing.</p>
<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Unit testing is when you test something in small, independent pieces. For example, in order to test a <code>DoublyLinkedList</code> class, you might write a small function that just tests that creating an empty list works, then another function that tests that <code>push_back</code> and the <code>begin</code>/<code>end</code> iterators work in a for-loop, and so on.</p>

<h2>Callable</h2>
<p>C++11 doesn't have a concept of a Callable directly, but in general it's anything that can be called. A function is a callable. An instance of a class that overloads the call operator is a callable. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda">Lambdas</a> are also callable, though you don't need to worry about them for a data structures and algorithms class. Here's a sample program to demonstrate the idea of a Callable that takes a single <code>int</code>.</p>
callable_demo.cpp<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// In order to work with both const and non-const Callables, we have to define
// two versions of the same function.
template &lt;typename Callable&gt;
void call(const Callable&amp; callable, int x) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;void call(const Callable&amp; callable, int x):&#34; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  callable(x);
}

template &lt;typename Callable&gt;
void call(Callable&amp; callable, int x) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;void call(Callable&amp; callable, int x):&#34; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  callable(x);
}

// const Callable (since the function can&#39;t be modified)
void print_int(int x) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;print_int(&#34; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &#34;)&#34; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

// non-const Callable (since when an instance is called, it modifies itself)
// IntPrinter is a silly class, to help demonstrate the idea of a &#34;callable&#34;.
class IntPrinter {
  int count;
public:
  IntPrinter(int initial_count=0) : count(initial_count) {}

  void operator()(int x) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;IntPrinter::operator()(&#34; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &#34;)  (call number &#34;
              &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; &#34;)&#34; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    ++count;
  }
};

int main() {
  call(print_int, 11);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  IntPrinter printer;
  call(printer, 22);
  call(printer, 33);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  IntPrinter printer2(1000);
  call(printer2, 44);
  call(printer2, 55);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  // lambdas are a C++11 feature, where you can create a &#39;function-like&#39; object
  // without having to actually define a whole function, and which has access
  // to local variables.
  // It&#39;s not strictly necessary to demonstrate the idea of a callable.
  // Since the lambda is const, we call the const version of call().
  call([](int x) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;lambda: &#34; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl;}, 66);
  return 0;

<h2>Algorithm Visualizations</h2>
<p>David Galles' wonderful set of <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html">algorithm visualizations</a>, cover a lot of the same algorithms covered in this class and allow you to interactively perform operations on data structures.</p>

<h2>Serialize and Deserialize</h2>
<p>There are two simple ways to serialize (write a file) and deserialize (read back from a file) an array of numbers. One writes out numbers like a person would write them. The other writes and reads the raw bytes in memory. Both are demonstrated below:</p>
read_write_ints.cpp<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

using namespace std;

  cin &gt;&gt; array[0] &gt;&gt; array[1] &gt;&gt; array[2];
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Numbers: &#34; &lt;&lt; array[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array[1] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array[2] &lt;&lt; endl;

  ofstream output_file(&#34;foo.txt&#34;);
  // Comment out one of the two lines below
  output_file.write((char *)array, 3 * sizeof(array[0]));
  output_file &lt;&lt; array[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array[1] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array[2];
  output_file.close();

  ifstream input_file(&#34;foo.txt&#34;);
  // Comment out one of the two lines below
  input_file.read((char *)array2, 3 * sizeof(array2[0]));
  input_file &gt;&gt; array2[0] &gt;&gt; array2[1] &gt;&gt; array2[2];
  input_file.close();

  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;You entered: &#34; &lt;&lt; array2[0] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array2[1] &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; array2[2] &lt;&lt; endl;
