<h2>Shortest Path</h2>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a></h3>

<p>Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from one node in a graph to another node by exploring the shortests paths it has found so far from the start node to the end node.</p>

<p>A* is exactly like Dijkstra's Algorithm, but with the addition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)">heuristic</a> for the minimum amount of distance between two nodes. It's only possible to have a useful heuristic when you know something special about the graph that you're working with. For example, if you know that you're working with a 2d map of a city, then you know that the minimum amount of distance you'd have to drive between two points on the map is the straight line distance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">or the great-circle distance</a>. Then, instead of always exploring the shortest path so far, you explore the smallest path-so-far + heuristic-between-your-current-node-and-the-goal-node.</p>
