<h2>Threads</h2>
<p>Most code executes one instruction at a time. One after another. Never multiple instructions simultaneously. Imagine what that would be like as a person. Imagine walking: Take a step, beat your heart twice, take a step, beat your heart twice, breath in, beat your heart twice, breath out, beat your heart twice, take another step. Your brain doesn't work like that, in fact it's kind of the exact opposite. Your brain does all those things at once and even though the part of your brain responsible for walking and breathing seem fairly independent, they're still able to communicate.</p>
<p>Threads allow you to write code where multiple things are happening at once, independently, but they're also able to communicate and use the same resources. In a typical C++ program, everything starts with the <code class="c++">main</code> function. When it stops, the program stops. Threads work similarly. When you create a thread, you tell it which function to run and what input it should have. When the thread is done running that function, it's done running.</p>
<p>Threads are very useful in all kinds of programming. For example, a web server might use a different thread to processes each request. That way, if one request is slow or needs to wait for something to finish, the other threads can keep processing requests.</p>
