<h2>C++11</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Weiss, Mark Allen. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++. Third Edition. Addison Wesley, 2006">third edition book for this class</abbr> doesn't cover C++11, however I will cover C++11 features and you can use any C++11 features.</p>
<p>One particularly great one is the <code class="c++"><a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-auto-decltype-return-value-after-function.html">auto</a></code> keyword, which allows you to write code like <code class="c++">for (auto&amp; value : myvector) std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> instead of <code class="c++">for (int32_t value : myvector) std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>.</p>

<h2>What's the <em>most</em> important thing about programs?</h2>
<p>Before answering, try to think about what kinds attributes of programs there are: speed, size, correctness, readability, time to write it, resources needed to run it, testability, etc. The answer is "it depends". What we'd like to have is the fastest, smallest, 100% correct, most readabile, easy to write program all the time, but you can't [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>].
</p>
<p>For most code, readability and correctness are both very important. Consider code that isn't correct: for a student, the student gets a bad grade, for a typical software engineer, they have to spend time debugging some code, and for a medical company, they give patients lethal doses of radiation like the <a href="http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3604/lib/Therac_25/Therac_1.html">Therac-25</a>. Consider code that isn't readable: if you can't read code, then it's much harder to know that it's correct and to change it. This is particularly important because almost any code you write is going to be big and complicated and chances are you'll want to add/remove/update features of that code.
</p>

<h2>Algorithm Analysis</h2>
<h3>Intro to an example problem</h3>
<p>In Data Structures and Algorithms class, all code should be correct. We'll go over ways to ensure your code is correct, like unit testing, but the main focus of the class will be on making your code fast for large data sets. Algorithm analysis can mean looking at many different attributes of an algorithm, but in this class we'll mostly be focused on analysing how fast algorithms are as the size of the input gets bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have an <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code> called <code>email_addresses</code> of email addresses of people you know. You'd like to write a program that can look at an email and quickly tell if it's someone you know. The simplest strategy to do this is to use <code><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/find/">std::find</a>(email_addresses<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/begin">.begin()</a>, email_addresses<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/end">.end()</a>)</code>. Behind the scenes, this is just like doing a for-loop over each email address in <code>email_addresses</code> until you find the one you're looking for or find out that it doesn't exist. We know that this works, but how fast is it? How does it's speed change as the number of email addresses gets larger? Let's say there are N email addresses. In the best case, the email address we're looking for is the first one, so we only have to take 1 step. In the worst case, we have to look check all N email addresses, so it takes on the order of N steps. This means that if we double the number of email adresses, searching for an email adress will probably take twice as long!</p>
<h3>Binary Search</h3>
<p>How can we do better? What if the email addresses were sorted alphabetically, the way <code>std::string</code>s would be?</p>
<p>If the email addresses are sorted, then we can do something really smart: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Binary Search</a>. When we're first given the email addresses, we don't know where the email address we're looking for is. It could be anywhere between a lower bound index <code>0</code> and upper bound index<code>email_addresses.size()</code> or maybe not there at all. First, we check the middle index <code>(0 + email_addresses.size()) / 2</code>. There are 3 cases: 1) we found the email address, 2) the email address in the middle is greater, or 3) the email address is less. Let's assume the email address in the middle was greater than the one we're looking for. In this case, we know that the email address we're looking for is between index <code>0</code> and the middle index. To continue binary search, we just keep repeating this process. Check the middle index, update our lower and upper bounds, and so on. Eventually we'll either find what we're looking for or our lower bound and upper bound will be equal, meaning that what we're looking for isn't there.</p>
<p>Is this faster than the other strategy? How much faster? To start, we'll try to think about how many "steps" it take, just like we did with the simple algorithm. In the best case, the email address we're looking for is right in the middle so we only take 1 step. In the worst case, we have to keep looking. Initially what we're looking for could be any of the N email addresses. After the first step, we know we can safely ignore N / 2 of the email addresses and we only have to care about N / 2 of the email addresses. After the second step we can ignore another (N / 2) / 2 of the steps and only have to care about (N / 2) / 2 of the email addresses. We keep cutting the number of possible email addresses in half over and over. Let's assume that we N = 1000. How many steps would Binary Search need in the worst case? </p>
<p>Eventually we'll get to just one email address to check and that will be the last step. In order to continue, let's review exponents and logarithms.</p>

<h3>Math Review: Exponents and Logarithms</h2>
<!-- https://xkcd.com/451/ -->
<p>Addition is to subtraction as multiplication is to division. Multiplication is to division as exponentiation is to logarithms.</p>
<p>Multiplication is basically just repeated addition. For example 3 * 5 is the same as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. Similarly, exponentiation is just repeated mutliplication so 3^5 (which in code is <code>pow(3, 5)</code>) is the same as 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. In a binary search algorithm, after performing K steps, we've cut the number of email addresses down to just N / 2^K.</p>
<p>Logarithms are the inverse of exponents. For example if 3^5 = 243 then "log base 3 of 243" or log(243, 3) = 5. Put another way log(243, 3) is the number of times you can divide 243 by 3 until you get to 1.</p>
<p>Here's some example code deomonstrating the <code>log</code> and <code>pow</code> functions.</p>
example_log_pow.cpp<pre><code class="c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  double x, y;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Enter x and y values: &#34;;
  cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;x == &#34; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &#34;, y == &#34; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;pow(x, y) == &#34; &lt;&lt; pow(x, y) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;log(pow(x, y)) / log(x) == &#34; &lt;&lt; log(pow(x, y)) / log(x) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; &#34;log base x of pow(x, y) == &#34; &lt;&lt; log(pow(x, y)) / log(x) &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}</code></pre><pre><strong>$</strong> <kbd>clang -pedantic -Wall -lm -lstdc++ -lpthread -std=c++11 -o example example_log_pow.cpp</kbd>
<strong>$</strong> <kbd>./example</kbd></pre><pre><samp>Enter x and y values: x == 3, y == 5
pow(x, y) == 243
log(pow(x, y)) / log(x) == 5
log base x of pow(x, y) == 5
</samp></pre>

<h3>Binary Search</h3>
<p>OK! Now that we know about logarithms, let's try to figure out how many steps Binary Search needs in the worst case if there are N email addresses. Each step of Binary Search cuts the number of possible email addresses in half, so the number of steps is the same as how many times we can divide N by 2. That's the same as log(N, 2). What's extra cool about this is that even if we double the number of email addresses we only add 1 step in the worst case instead of adding N steps!</p>
