<h3>Programming Assignments (Grade Oven)</h3>
<p>All programming assignments will be submitted to <a href="https://gradeoven.com/courses/CS%202C">gradeoven.com</a>.  Grade Oven will compile and run your code, then give you an instant grade and show your ranking compared to other students (though it won't show real names).  Details on how to login will be in your email and/or on Canvas.</p>

<h3>Grade Information</h3>
<p>Grades are based on programming lab assignments (75% of grade) and the midterm exam and final exam (25% of grade).  There will be a curve.</p>

<h3>Class Policies</h3>
<h4>Late Policy</h4>
<p>Homeworks may be turned in almost arbitrarily late. Your score will be calculated as the average of your scores before and after the deadline.</p>
<h4>Cheating</h4>
<p>It's a bad way to end a relationship and it's a bad way to end a class.  Please discuss all assignments/homework where the whole class can see it, for example on the <a href="https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/1426/discussion_topics">Canvas forums</a>.  Any variation of copying programming lab assignments is prohibited.  The assignment must be 100% your own work.</p>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<p>Foothill instructors are required to drop all students who do not show up during the first 2 weeks of class.</p>

<h2>Academic Support</h2>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>Opportunities for Foothill Computer Science students are posted at <a href="http://csopportunities.blogspot.com/">csopportunities.blogspot.com</a> such as announcements for internships, scholarships, free software offers, pertinent public lectures, etc.</p>
<h3>STEM Center</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.psme.foothill.edu/?page_id=48">STEM Center</a>, in room 4213, will have CS tutors at various times each day. The STEM Center is also a place on main campus where students without their own computers can do their lab work.  Please ask about online computer science tutors and checkout the <a href="http://www.psme.foothill.edu/?page_id=86">STEM Center schedule</a>.</p>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>To obtain disability-related accommodations, students must contact <a href="http://foothill.edu/drc/">Disability Resource Center</a> (DRC) as early as possible in the quarter.  To contact DRC, you may visit DRC in <a href="http://foothill.edu/news/locations.php?act=f&rec_id=335">Room 5400</a>, email DRC at <a href="mailto:adaptivelearningdrc@foothill.edu" target="_top">adaptivelearningdrc@foothill.edu</a>, and/or call DRC at <a href="tel:650-949-7017">650-949-7017</a> to make an appointment.  If you already have an accommodation notification from DRC, please contact me privately to discuss your needs.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.fgamedia.org/faculty/loceff/cs_courses/common/slos/cs_slos_1.html">Student Learning Outcomes</a></h3>
<h4>C++ Inheritance</h4>
<p>A successful student will be able to write and debug C++ programs which make use of inheritance, i.e., the "is a" relationship, common to all OOP languages. Specifically, the student will define base and derived classes and use common techniques such as method chaining in his or her programs.</p>

<h4>Basic C++ Abstract Data Types</h4>
<p>A successful student will be able to use the C++ environment to define the basic abstract data types (stacks, queues, lists) and iterators of those types to effectively manipulate the data in his or her program.</p>
