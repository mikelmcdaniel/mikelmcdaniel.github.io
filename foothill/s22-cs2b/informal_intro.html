<p>Welcome to CS 2B Intermediate Software Design In C++, Spring 2022!</p>
<h2>A Quick 'About me'</h2>
<p>My name is Mikel Mcdaniel, pronounced like Mick-El. I've taught 1B/2B 3 times and 2C 4 times. I have about 8 years of full-time software engineering experience and have done most of my teaching while working, including this class.</p>
<p>Some of my non-software interests include running, ping pong, and Smash Bros. I could say more but I think we'll all get to know each other a bit during the quarter.</p>
<h2>What you can expect from me</h2>
<h3>Informal respect</h3>
<p>Please feel free to call me by my first name or my last name if you prefer. If you're stuck on something and not sure how to start a conversation, you can just say you're stuck and I'll work with you to help you out.</p>
<p>Talk to me and your fellow students like you would talk to a helpful coworker and we will do the same. You can be formal or informal, as long as you are nice.</p>
<h3>Responsive</h3>
<p>In the past, I taught in person and I've had a very interactive teaching style. You should expect that some of the material (written notes, coding examples, or short lecture videos) might be sparse or have mistakes (usually just typos). At the same time, you should expect that I will be available and responsive. When you email me, I'll reply quickly and update the material quickly.</p>
<h3>Class will be hard but you'll have support</h3>
<p>My personal goals are to inspire you to want to learn and practice computer science and software engineering, for you to learn as much possible in the <a href="https://catalog.foothill.edu/course-outlines/C-S-2B/">official CS 2B course outline</a> as well as some good programming and software engineering practices (like testing and code review), and to give you a grade that accurate reflects what you've learned. -- If I've done my job well and you're able to put in the effort, you will love computer science and software engineering and get an A+. That does not mean it will be an easy class; it's never easy to learn something like C++ deeply and that's why I'm here to help.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Read over the <a href="syllabus">Syllabus</a> and email me <em>or</em> post a Canvas Discussion if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Check Canvas for the first homework!</p>
