<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Foothill College, Fall 2021<br />
Course: CS 2C - Data Structures and Algorithms in C++  </p>
<h2>Instructor Contact Information</h2>
<p>Mikel Mcdaniel<br />
<a href="mailto:mcdanielmikel@fhda.edu?subject=CS%202C%20">McdanielMikel@fhda.edu</a> (Email any time, as much you want.)<br />
Office hours: TBD.</p>
<h2>Texts, Readings, Materials</h2>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: Weiss, Mark Allen. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-C/dp/013284737X">Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++. Fourth Edition.</a> Addison Wesley, 2014. ISBN-13: 978-0132847377. ISBN-10: 013284737X.</p>
<p>This book was published in 2014, so it's missing the latest C++ features from <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14">C++14</a>, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17">C++17</a>, and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20">C++20</a>. Feel free to use the newer features or not use them. Any <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">C++20 features supported by clang</a> are ok to use in your homework. We'll cover some of the more simple/useful ones in class.</p>
<h2>Detailed Course Information</h2>
<h3>Tentative Course Schedule and Content</h3>
<p>The specific content below is <em>tentative</em>, but this course will cover everything in the <a href="https://foothill.edu/schedule/outlines.html">official CS 2C course outline</a>.</p>

<h3>Homeworks</h3>
<p>You'll have a new homework every 1-2 weeks. Homeworks will involve some coding and non-coding parts.</p>
<p>All <strong>coding</strong> assignments will be submitted to <a href="https://gradeoven.com/courses/CS%202C">gradeoven.com</a>. Grade Oven will compile and run your code, then give you an instant grade. You can submit as many times as you like. Make sure to save your code because Grade Oven only keeps your last submission. Details on how to login will be in your email and/or on Canvas.</p>
<p>All <strong>non-coding</strong> assignments will be submitted on Canvas.</p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be weekly quizzes.</p>
<h3>Grade Information</h3>
<p>I'm trying something new this quarter: Each assignment and quiz will have a mark (amazing, done, and not-done-yet). If you complete all assignments and quizzes, you get an A.</p>
<h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>
<p>My goal as an instructor is (1) to teach you as much about the course material as possible, (2) to teach you as much about actual job/engineering skills as possible, and (3) to give you a grade that reflects your skills. -- Making every point on every assignment counts causes students to get stressed and focus more on a "grade" than learning. That stress leads to worse outcomes, especially for non-white and non-rich students. These kinds of changes (known as "ungrading") are theoretically neutral but lead to better outcomes for all students.</p>
<h3>Class Policies</h3>
<h4>Late Policy</h4>
<p>Homework may be turned in almost arbitrarily late. Your score will be calculated as the average of your scores before and after the deadline. (For example, if you got 30% before the deadline and then 90% after the deadline, your final grade for that homework will be 30% + 90% / 2 == 60%.)</p>
<h4>Cheating and Plagiarism</h4>
<p>Please discuss all assignments/homework where the whole class can see it, in the Canvas forums or on the Discord server.</p>
<p>Cite your sources. It's common for professionals and amateurs to copy code from the internet. Copying code without citing your sources is cheating. A simple comment with a URL and date in it are good enough! If you're not copying code directly but got some ideas from a video, website, or book, please cite that too! It's a good way to share ideas.</p>
<p>Don't cheat. Reporting cheating is tedious. Secretly writing negative letters of recommendation is <em>less</em> tedious.</p>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<p>Foothill instructors are required to drop all students who do not complete any coursework the first 2 weeks of class.</p>
<h2>Academic Support</h2>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>Opportunities for Foothill Computer Science students are posted at <a href="http://csopportunities.blogspot.com/">csopportunities.blogspot.com</a> such as announcements for internships, scholarships, free software offers, pertinent public lectures, etc.</p>
<h3>STEM Center</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foothill.edu/stemcenter/">STEM Center</a> offers online tutoring for computer science and other subjects, including drop-in tutoring via Zoom.</p>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>To obtain disability-related accommodations, students must contact <a href="http://foothill.edu/drc">Disability Resource Center</a> (DRC) as early as possible in the quarter. You can email DRC at <a href="mailto:adaptivelearningdrc@foothill.edu">adaptivelearningdrc@foothill.edu</a>, and/or call DRC at <a href="tel:650-949-7017">650-949-7017</a> to make an appointment. If you already have an accommodation notification from DRC or get one in the future, please contact me privately to let me know your needs.</p>
