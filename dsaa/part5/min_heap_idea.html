<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UP3_aVGN9VE">Min Heap Idea video (24 minutes) (Spring 2021)</a></p>
<p>The Priority Queue ADT, which we will see in more detail in later lectures, is a queue in which elements are processed in some priority order.  This is different from a standard queue, that has a first-in-first-out processing order.</p>
<p>Priority Queues are often implemented using the Min Heap data structure, which is covered in this lecture.</p>
<h3>Array representation of tree (review)</h3>
<p>Min Heaps are a type of tree, that can take advantage of the array representation benefits covered in the previous lecture.</p>
<p>Getting the "next" element in a Priority Queue based on Min Heap is O(1) due to array indexing.  </p>
<p>Removing from the queue is still O(log(n)), based on the height of a tree having n elements.</p>
<h3>Min Heap definition, Max Heap</h3>
<p>A Min Heap is a tree that has a less restrictive ordering property than that of a Binary Search Tree.  A Min Heap does NOT have the BST ordering property, where a left child is smaller than a node, and a right child is greater.</p>
<p>In a Min Heap, a parent node is simply less than or equal to its child nodes.</p>
<p>This is a valid Min Heap tree. Each node is smaller than its children.  It is also a full binary tree.</p>
<pre><code>       B
     /  \
    M     P
  /  \   /
 W   V  X
</code></pre>

<p>A Max Heap is the exact opposite of a Min Heap.  The same ordering property exists, but in the opposite form.  Each node is LARGER than its children.</p>
<h3>Heap Operations</h3>
<p>The basic operations of a heap are top, push, and pop.</p>
<h4>top()</h4>
<p>Get the next element to process (in terms of a priority queue), or, the root of the tree.  This is simply returning index 0 in the array implementation.</p>
<h3>push()</h3>
<p>Insert element into the next available spot (bottom right of the tree).</p>
<p>Since the element might not be in the right location (for Min Heap ordering), it will be swapped or percolated UP, with its parent node, until the Min-Heap ordering property is valid again, aka, until it is no longer less than its parent node.</p>
<h3>pop()</h3>
<p>Remove the root element.</p>
<p>Since we need to maintain a full binary tree, the last element (bottom right of the tree) is swapped up to the root position.</p>
<p>It is then swapped or percolated DOWN the Min Heap, exchanging places with the smaller child, until the Min-Heap ordering property is valid again, aka, until it is no longer great than the smaller child node.</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>push() and pop() are O(log(n)), since they scale in complexity with the height of the tree.</p>
<p>top() is O(1), since it is a simple array access at index 0.</p>
<h2>Concept of Priority</h2>
<p>In a Heap implementation of Priority Queue, the root node of the heap is the "next in line", or highest priority element.  </p>
<p>In a Min Heap, the smallest element is at the root, and thus has highest priority in a Priority Queue based on that Min Heap.</p>
<p>In a Max Heap, the largest element is at the root, and thus has highest priority in a Priority Queue based on that Max Heap.</p>
<p>Min vs Max ordering does not change the concept of priority.  It is safe to say that both types of ordering may be encountered "in the wild".</p>
<p>No matter which ordering we use, the highest priority is the root of the heap, for purposes of implementing a Priority Queue with that heap as the underlying data structure.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to Brian Foster for writing up these notes based on the video lectures.</p>
