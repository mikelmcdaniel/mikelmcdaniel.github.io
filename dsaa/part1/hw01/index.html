<h2>Homework 01. Compromise Search</h2>
<p>The goal of this homework is to write an algorithm that gets the best of Linear Search and Binary Search by using Binary Search on large inputs until you narrow down the range to some 'small size', then using Linear Search for the remaining elements. -- Make sure your implementation switches from a Binary Search approach to a Linear Search approach!</p>
<h2>Part 1: Implement compromise_search.h</h2>
<p>The goal of this part of the assignment is to practice your skills translating an idea/algorithm to code.</p>
<p>Implement the <code>compromise_search</code> function and submit your implementation in a filed named "compromise_search.h".</p>
<h3>compromise_search.h</h3>
<pre><code class="c++">// Compromise Search is a compromise between Binary Search and Linear Search:
//   We use Binary Search until we get to small_size elements, then we switch to Linear Search.
//   Binary Search between low and high until the gap between low and high is &lt;= small_size,
//   then use std::find on the range (from low to high).
// For example,
// vector&lt;string&gt; words = {&quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;, &quot;ddd&quot;, &quot;eee&quot;};
// cout &lt;&lt; *compromise_search(words.begin(), words.end(), &quot;bbb&quot;, 3) &lt;&lt; endl;
// will print &quot;bbb\n&quot;.
// compromise_search will
// - calculate the middle
// - see that &quot;bbb&quot; &lt; &quot;ccc&quot; (and update the upper bound)
// - see that the remaining range (from &quot;aaa&quot; to &quot;ccc&quot; exclusive)
//   has &lt;= small_size (3) elements
// - use std::find to search through the remaining range
//   (from &quot;aaa&quot; to &quot;ccc&quot; exclusive)
//
// RandomAccessIt is a random-access iterator, like vector&lt;string&gt;::begin().
// low is inclusive and high is exclusive.
template&lt;class RandomAccessIt, class T&gt;
RandomAccessIt compromise_search(
    RandomAccessIt low, RandomAccessIt high, const T&amp; value, int small_size) {
  // your code here...
}
</code></pre>

<p>RandomAccessIt is a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator">RandomAccessIterator</a>, like <code>std::vector&lt;string&gt;::begin()</code> or  <code>std::vector&lt;string&gt;::end()</code>.</p>
<p>You can do many things with <code>RandomAccessIt</code> that you can do with pointers. For example, if you have two random access iterators (for the same collection), p1 and p2, you can...</p>
<ul>
<li>dereference: <code>*p1</code></li>
<li>increment (or decrement): <code>++p1</code> or <code>p1++</code> (or <code>--p1</code> or <code>p1--</code>)</li>
<li>compare: <code>p1 == p2</code> or <code>p1 &lt; p2</code></li>
<li>subtract: <code>p2 - p1</code></li>
<li>add an offset: <code>p1 + some_int</code> (e.g. <code>p1 + 5</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <code>std::find</code> as long as you only call it once and only on a range of elements that's <code>&lt;= small_size</code> in size. (So you can't call it on the whole input)</p>
<p>If you can find some way to have <code>std::binary_search</code> switch to a Linear Search part-way through (the moment you've narrowed the search down to <code>&lt;= small_size</code> elements), then you can use it but it's probably easier to just implement your own Binary Search that switches to Linear Search part-way through.</p>
<h3>Simple Manual Test program</h3>
<p>This program is provided to help you understand how <code>compromise_search</code> should work.</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submit your code (only your <code>compromise_search.h</code> file) on gradeoven.com.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Explore compromise_search.h</h2>
<p>The goal of this part of the assignment is to practice your skills as an engineer: think about how your code should perform in theory, check how it performs in reality, and document what you find.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>You're going to write a <em>short</em> PDF report about your code. The exact format is up to you!</p>
<p>Here's what I'd like you to think about when writing your report:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the big-O of <code>std::find</code>?</li>
<li>What's the big-O of <code>std::binary_search</code>?</li>
<li>What's the big-O of your code?</li>
<li>On your computer in practice, does your code appear to have the big-O you expect?</li>
<li>How fast is your code compared to <code>std::binary_search</code> in practice on your computer?</li>
<li>What's a good values for <code>small_size</code>?</li>
<li>Anything else you want!</li>
</ul>
<p>You are welcome to talk about this part of the assignment with your classmates <strong>as long as you don't share compromise_search.h code</strong>. If your conclusions are different than theirs, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submit your report as a PDF on Canvas. If you have any supporting documents/code/etc., submit them as well.</p>
