<p>In computer science, the word graph refers to a set of nodes/vertices connected by edges/links.</p>
<p>The same meaning of graph shows up in Discrete mathematics and Graph theory. We are <strong>not</strong> talking about the x-axis/y-axis graphs, or the "stocks go up" type of graph.</p>
<p>A graph can be simply thought of as "things, with connections".</p>
<p>The things are called nodes, or vertices (we will use the word node in this class). For example, intersections in a city or people.</p>
<p>The connections are called edges. For example, roads between intersections or friend ships.</p>
<h2>Directed and Undirected Graphs</h2>
<p>Graphs can be undirected, or directed.</p>
<p>Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. This indicates a two-way relationship, like a two-way street in the city intersections example. You can travel from each node to the other.</p>
<p>Directed graphs have edges with direction. This indicates a one-way relationship, and the edge can only be traversed in a single direction, like a one-way street in the city intersections example.</p>
<h2>Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs</h2>
<p>Graphs can have cycles. A cycle means that there is a path in the graph from at least one node back to itself.</p>
<p>Cyclic graphs have cycles, like intersections in a city.</p>
<p>Acyclic graphs do not have cycles, like your family tree (where family members are nodes and the parent-child relationships are edges).</p>
<h2>File system example</h2>
<p>You can think of a computer's file system as a graph. From the root folder, down, each folder may contain multiple folders. Folders can be thought of as nodes.</p>
<p>A file system is an acyclic graph (ignoring symlinks), and has a tree-like structure of hierarchy.</p>
<p>For example, on a typical Linux file system, the "/" directories contains the "/bin", "/home", and "/etc" directories along with many others and "/home" will contain a directory for various users (e.g. "/home/mikel" on my laptop). Each of these directories is a node we can think of each connection as an edge.</p>
<h2>Internet example</h2>
<p>Another example is the internet: Each website or page can be a node and every link to another website or page is an edge.</p>
