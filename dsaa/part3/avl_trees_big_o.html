  <h1 class="visually-hidden">AVL Tree Big-O</h1>
  </p>

<h2>General Idea</h2>
<p>The Big-O of BST operations correlates with the height of the BST.  </p>
<p>"What is the worst case (tallest) height for n nodes?"</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer.  But, the inverse question can be asked:</p>
<p>"For some height, what is the smallest number of nodes that a tree of that height can have?"</p>
<p>This will give the worst case, or tallest, height for that number of nodes.</p>
<h2>AVL Trees</h2>
<p>To be an AVL tree, each node's subtree must have a left and right subtree that differ in height by no more than 1.</p>
<p>With that constraint in mind, we can plot out a few AVL trees, answering the question that we have posed:</p>
<p>"For some height, what is the smallest number of nodes that a tree of that height can have?"</p>
<p>height = 1
An AVL tree of height 1 can be built with a single node.</p>
<pre><code>O
</code></pre>

<p>height = 2
An AVL tree of height 2 can be built with 2 nodes.</p>
<pre><code>O
 \
  O
</code></pre>

<p>height = 2
An AVL tree of height 2 can be built with 2 nodes.</p>
<pre><code>O
 \
  O
</code></pre>

<p>height = 3
An AVL tree of height 3 can be built with 4 nodes.</p>
<pre><code>   O
  / \
 O   O
      \
       O
</code></pre>

<p>height = 4
An AVL tree of height 4 can be built with 7 nodes.</p>
<pre><code>    O
   / \
  O   O
 /   / \
O   O   O
         \
          O
</code></pre>

<h2>Identifying a Trend</h2>
<p>"For some height, what is the smallest number of nodes that a tree of that height can have?"</p>
<p>We have started to collect data points to answer this question.</p>
<pre><code>height  | Nodes for this height
------------------------------
    0   |  0
    1   |  1
    2   |  2
    3   |  4
    4   |  7
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a pattern to be seen in the graphs of these AVL trees.  Look at the trees of height 4, 3, and 2.  </p>
<p>The tree of height 4 consists of a root node, and a subtree of height 3, and a subtree of height 2.  Both subtrees (of height 2 and 3), are the trees that we have graphed, that have the minimum number of nodes to attain this height.</p>
<p>An AVL tree of height h, consists of a root node, an AVL subtree of height h-1, and an AVL subtree of height h-2</p>
<p>Phrasing this as N(h), for, number of nodes for a given height, this can be termed as</p>
<p>N(h) = 1 + N(h - 1) + N(h - 2)</p>
<p>This is a recurrence relation!  And it's a hard one to solve.</p>
<p>Solving it for several values:</p>
<pre><code>h  | N(h)
---------
0  |  0
1  |  1
2  |  2
3  |  4
4  |  7
5  |  12
6  |  20
7  |  33
8  |  54
</code></pre>

<p>There are two things to notice about this trend.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is similar to Fibonacci sequence!  Just offset by one.  Remember, Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2).</li>
<li>Looking at the table, there seems to be an exponential relation.  As h increases by 1, N(h) "almost" doubles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly to the Fibonacci recursive function, the number of nodes for a given height grows by 1.6^h.  </p>
<p>(The recurrence relation is expanded to prove/demonstrate this at 18:12 in the lecture video.)</p>
<p>So, n = 1.6^h</p>
<p>So, inversely, h = log(n).</p>
<p>The height of an AVL tree having n nodes is O(log(n)).</p>
