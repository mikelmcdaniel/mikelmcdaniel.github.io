<h2>(Unbalanced) Binary Search Tree Average Big-O</h2>
<p>Inserting elements into an unbalanced BST in sorted order will lead to a BST that looks like a linked list.  With all right children (or all left children if they are inserted in reverse-sorted order).</p>
<p>However, random insertions roughly balance themselves out.  On average, subtrees will be roughly balanced.</p>
<h3>Average-Case Analysis</h3>
<p>With n nodes inserted into a BST, there are n! (n factorial) possible insertion permutations.</p>
<p>The Big-O of a BST operation depends on the depth of the node being inserted/deleted/found.</p>
<p>From any node, the depth of its subtree = max(LeftSubTreeDepth, RightSubtreeDepth) + 1.</p>
<p>I like to use the convention that empty tree has height = 0 but it is also common to say that an empty tree has height -1.</p>
<p>The average depth over all nodes in a BST is O(log(n)) on the assumption that all insertion sequences/permutations are equally likely.</p>
<h3>Average height of an unbalanced BST</h3>
<p>In this section we will describe a sum expression that describes the average height of nodes in an unbalanced BST.</p>
<p>With n possible root nodes, there is a (1/n) chance of each being the root.</p>
<p>An n-node tree consists of a left subtree with i nodes, and an right subtree with n - i - 1 nodes.</p>
<p>The height of a tree can be described as max(height(left), height(right)) + 1.</p>
<p>H(n) can be defined to be the average height of a tree.
So, H(n) = 1 + SUM (from i = 0 to n - 1) of (1 / n) * (max(H(i), H(n - i - 1)) + 1)</p>
<p>This sum is written clearly in sigma notation at 20:10 in the lecture video, and simplified at 21:03.</p>
<h3>Takeaway : BST's give O(log(n)) depth and running time</h3>
<p>The above sum simplifies to H(n) = O(log(n)), so no matter how many nodes a tree has, doubling the number of nodes (assuming they're all inserted in a random order) will increase the height of the tree by about the same mount on average.</p>
<p>For now, we are skipping the complicated proof to work this out.  A later lecture video computes it programatically though!</p>
<h4>Thanks</h4>
<p>Thanks to Brian Foster for typing up the rough draft of these notes based on the lecture video.</p>
