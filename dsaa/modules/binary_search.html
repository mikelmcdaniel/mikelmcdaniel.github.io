  </p>
<p>If you haven't read the Linear Search notes, read those first.</p>
<h2>Binary Search</h2>
<p>Linear Search might be fast for small inputs but if you the input (the number of things you're searching through) becomes twice as big, it's going to take about twice as long to search. If the input gets K times as big, it's going to take about K times as long to search.</p>
<p>We can do better! With Binary Search and a <em>sorted</em> list, if we double the size of the input, it'll take the same amount of extra time no matter how big the input is.</p>
<p>For the rest of this page, we'll use an example where we have a list of words and we want to know if some word is in that list. This might be useful for checking if a word is an English word, like when you're typing and you see the red squiggly lines under the word because it's mispelled, or if you implemented a game like Scrabble and you want to know if a word is valid or not.</p>
<h3>Idea</h3>
<p>Let's walk through an example, searching for the word "olive" in this sorted list:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>index</th>
<th>word</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>apple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>banana</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>durian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>lemon</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>lime</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>mango</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>peach</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>pear</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>raspberry</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since the list is sorted, you know that if the word you're looking for is in the list, it must be between the first word (at index 0) and the last word (at index 9). Binary Search is a process of elimination. We can look in the middle and see if that middle word comes before or after "olive"... and just keep repeating this until we either find "olive" or eliminate all words in the list.</p>
<p>Note: In C++ and many programming languages, it is idiomatic to represent a range of integers by including the lower bound and excluding the upper bound!</p>
<p>At each step, you check the middle word in the range. Since we start with [0, 10), we first look at index 5: "mango".</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>lower bound</th>
<th>upper bound</th>
<th>middle index</th>
<th>middle word</th>
<th>what happens</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>(1 + 10) / 2 == 5</td>
<td>mango</td>
<td>"olive" comes after "mango" so we update the lower bound to be just past "mango"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>(6 + 10) / 2 == 8</td>
<td>pear</td>
<td>"olive" comes before "pear" so we update the upper bound to be just before "pear"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>(6 + 8) / 2 == 7</td>
<td>peach</td>
<td>"olive" comes before "peach" so we update the upper bound</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>(6 + 7) / 2 == 6</td>
<td>orange</td>
<td>"olive" comes before "orange" so we update the upper bound</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>(6 + 6) / 2 == 6</td>
<td>orange</td>
<td>now our range is empty (lower bound == upper bound), so we know "olive" is not in the list</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In practice, it looks like it's much faster than Linear Search, at least for larger inputs. It's possible that Binary Search is actually slower for small inputs but by eliminating half of the possible words at every iteration instead of only one word, even a slow Binary Search will beat a Linear Search on large inputs.</p>
<p>This begs the question, if Linear Search has to iterate for every word in the worse case scenario, how many times does Binary Search have to iterate? We know that in the base cases (when we narrow down the range to 1 word or 0 words), it only takes one iteration. We also know that for the general/recursive case, we cut the range of possible words in half. So basically, if there are N words, the most iterations we might do (the most recursive calls we might do) is the same as the number of times we can divide N by 2: log base 2 of N.</p>
