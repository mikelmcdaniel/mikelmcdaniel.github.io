  </p>
<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>There are many options for the final project. You only have to do one of them.</p>
<p>I'm making this all up! If you have other ideas for a final project that aren't like anything I put here, message me via email, Canvas, or Discord!</p>
<h3>1. Get a 10-week (or longer) coding internship</h3>
<p>If you can prove that you have a full-time 10-week (or longer) coding internship (or job), you'll get full credit.</p>
<p>If you taught or mentored other people in coding <strong>data structures or algorithms</strong>, that would also count.</p>
<h4>What you turn in</h4>
<p>You'll turn in <em>some</em> form of proof, like an offer letter.</p>
<h3>2. Resume/Personal Project</h3>
<p>Do something interesting that involves some actual data structures or algorithms and record a 10-minute (or longer) presentation about it. You're welcome to chat with your classmates (or whoever) to come up with project ideas. Check with me first to see if your project idea will work. What I'm looking for is something that involves you writing some data structures or algorithms. You can work with your classmates. If you're thinking about a group project, check with me first.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of projects that would count:
- Cheating at drawing on sketchful.io (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-PSeHpfF1NpKHMW7vEGZIgsJJpDZrnrzSWVo2c4d52w/edit#slide=id.ga1227cd49f_0_194">Demo Slides</a>) (This project counts because of the algorithms used to convert an image to a drawing. If it was just a program that recorded what someone drew and drew that same drawing again, it would probably not count.).
- A Connect-4 engine that's good enough to beat humans
    - If you choose a project like this, it does not need to be pretty but it does need <em>some</em> UI, even if it's just text-based in a terminal.
- <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Floyd.html">A website that visualizes some algorithms</a> (e.g. some sorting algorithms, or that lets you insert and remove elements from an AVL Tree and shows you the steps)
- Implement a couple data structures and algorithms we didn't cover in class (e.g. a Trie and a Red-Black tree)
    - If you choose this kind of project, you'll need to turn in a presentation, paper, recorded video, or something else that shows that you understand how your code works.</p>
<p>Here are some projects that would not count:
- Doing one of the homeworks from this class
- A Tic-Tac-Toe engine (It's too simple)
- <a href="https://jspaint.app/">An "MS Paint" clone</a></p>
<p>I want you to pick a project that shows and/or helps you build data structures and algorithms skills. If you choose to do a project, you must let me know what your project ideas are, then I'll let you know if it sounds like a good project and help you plan it.</p>
<h3>3. Mock Interviews</h3>
<p>To do this final project, you must give two mock interviews <em>and</em> get mock interviewed twice. You can interview and get interviewed by the same person but you cannot interview the same person twice or get interviewed by the same person twice.</p>
<p>Give two mock interviews to two different people using the same question. You cannot interview them at the same time. Make sure to write up feedback from your interviews and include a copy of their code in the feedback. Choose an easy question too! If they solve it too quickly or have seen that question before, have a backup question ready.</p>
<p>Get mock interviewed by two different people.</p>
<p>The people don't need to be other students in this class. You can use a third-party service to get and give interviews. As long as they interviews are about data structures and algorithms and the interviewer knows how to solve their own problem, that's good enough.</p>
<h4>What you'll turn in</h4>
<p>You'll turn in the following
- From when you gave an interview:
    - The question(s) you asked them
    - Your notes
    - Their code
- From when you were interviewed:
    - The question(s) they asked you
    - Your code</p>
<p>You do not need to record the interview. If you choose to, I might be able to give some extra feedback but you get a better grade.</p>
<h4>Mock Interview Format</h4>
<p>Each mock interview has 3 parts:
- A short introduction
- The actual interview (30-50 minutes)
    - Interviewer asks an easier version of the question
    - Candidate asks clarifying questions, gives example inputs/outputs, and talks about ideas for how to solve it
    - Interviewer responds answers questions and talks about candidates ideas for how to solve the problem
    - Candidate writes code!
    - Interviewer asks what the big-O of time and space is
- Give feedback in person. You only need to help them improve one thing they could do better. Be nice.</p>
<h4>Mock Interview Feedback Rubric</h4>
<p>Take notes about the person you're interviewing in these categories. It can be short; it doesn't need to be a transcript.</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication: Did they seem to understand what you were saying? Did you understand the solutions.</li>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms: Did they solve the question in a relatively efficient way? (Is the big-O of their solution good?)</li>
<li>Coding: Is their code well organized? (e.g. Is all their code in one very long function or is it split into N easier to understand functions? Did they use globals unnecessarily? Is their code far away from compiling? Note: A missing semicolon or other small mistakes are ok but big mistakes are not.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>What counts as an interview question?</h4>
<p>Check with me first!</p>
<ul>
<li>Most coding-based question you're likely to see in real life</li>
<li>Most questions from <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Final Exam</h3>
<p>If you'd like to take a final exam instead of a project or mock interviews, let me know. If enough people (at least 5) are interested, I will write a final (which will be similar to the quizzes but larger) and you will need to schedule a one-on-one office hours appointment with me so I can ask you questions about it over Zoom.</p>
