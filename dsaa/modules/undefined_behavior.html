  <h1 class="visually-hidden">Undefined Behavior</h1>
  </p>
<p>Before we talk about Data Structures and Algorithms in this class, we should talk about C++. There are lots of languages out there, with different goals and strange behaviors. Understanding <em>how and why</em> C++ is unique will allow you to write better code.</p>
<p>C++ is largely designed for expressability (you can represent high level ideas with classes but also modify bits at a low level with pointers), portability (C++ runs well on all kinds of hardware from tiny microcontrollers in cars to large computers in datacenters), and efficiency (C++ is fast and memory efficient, when written well). At the same time, it's an older programming language that evolved from the simpler C language and gets new additions and changes about once every 3 years. If you ever think to yourself "Oh my god! C++, why are you like this!?", you're not alone and you should ask questions about it in the <a href="https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/16873/discussion_topics">Canvas Discussions</a>. There is no best language, there is the best language for the job.</p>
<h2>Undefined Behavior</h2>
<p>Undefined behavior is essentially anything not defined by the C++ standard, such as what happens when a signed integer type like <code>int</code> overflows. The compiler is allowed to do literally whatever it wants when there is undefined behavior, according to the C++ standard. This is not the same as unspecified behavior: <code>"hi" == "hi"</code> <em>is guaranteed</em> to be <code>true</code> xor <code>false</code> but you can't know which so it is unspecified but not undefined. When something is undefined behavior, your entire program could just be one giant bug that will do anything between working exactly as you expect to corrupting memory and crashing hours later.</p>
<p>C++'s efficiency comes at a price. Compilers are allowed to assume your code doesn't contain any undefined behavior and they use that assumption to optimize your code. When you're writing code at home, you might never notice anything bad happen even if there's undefined behavior in your program <em>but</em> if you turn on optimizations, compile with a different compiler (including a later version of the same compiler), or just get unlucky, your program might start doing something completely different even when it worked before.</p>
<p>If you'd like a deep explanation of Undefined Behavior, <em>beyond what I expect you to know for this class</em>, I recommend <a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">"What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior"</a> by Chris Lattner on LLVM's blog, "Undefined Behavior in 2017" by John Regehr <a href="https://youtu.be/v1COuU2vU_w">part 1</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/TPyLrJED0zQ">part 2</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/XEXpwis_deQ">"Undefined Behavior is Not an Error"</a> by Barbara Geller and Ansel Sermersheim.</p>
