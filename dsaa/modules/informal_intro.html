  </p>
<p>Welcome to CS 2C Data Structures and Algorithms, Spring 2021!</p>
<h2>A Quick 'About me'</h2>
<p>I'm Mikel Mcdaniel (pronounced like Mick-El). I've taught this class 3 times and 1B/2B 3 times while working a full time job as a software engineer at Google, specifically as a site reliability engineer on storage systems. That's actually my first full time job of 7.5 years and I recently left to take a long vacation and do something fun, like teaching this class.</p>
<p>Some of my non-software interests include running, ping pong, and Smash Bros. I could say more but I think we'll all get to know each other a bit during the quarter.</p>
<h2>What you can expect from me and vice versa</h2>
<h3>No need to be formal, if you're respectful</h3>
<p>I like to be informal and have genuine conversations with the people around me, so please feel free to call me by my first name or my last name if you prefer. If you're stuck on something and not sure how to start a conversation, you can just say that and I'll work with you to help you out.</p>
<p>Talk to me and others like you would talk to a helpful coworker and I will do the same.</p>
<h3>Material will be imperfect and I'll be responsive</h3>
<p>In the past, I taught in person and I've had a very interactive teaching style. You should expect that some of the material (written notes, coding examples, or short lecture videos) might be sparse or have mistakes. At the same time, you should expect that I will be available and responsive (i.e. when you email me, I'll reply quickly and update the material quickly).</p>
<p>Most of the material in the class has corresponding chapters/sections in the optional text book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-C/dp/013284737X">Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++. Fourth Edition. by Mark Allen Weiss</a>, but the course material on Canvas should be all you need.</p>
<h3>CS 2C will be hard but you'll have support</h3>
<p>My personal goals are to inspire you to want to learn and practice computer science and software engineering, for you to learn as much possible in the official CS 2C course outline as well as some good programming and software engineering practices (like testing and code review), and to give you a grade that accurate reflects what you've learned. -- If I've done my job well and you're able to put in the effort, you will love computer science and software engineering and get an A+. That does not mean it will be an easy class; it's never easy to learn something like CS 2C deeply but I'm here to help.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Tell me and the other students about yourself by replying to the <a href="https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/16873/discussion_topics/479113">Who are you?  discussion on Canvas</a>.</p>
<p>Read over the <a href="https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/16873/assignments/syllabus">syllabus</a> and email me <em>or</em> post a Canvas Discussion if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Take a look at the the first homework, <a href="https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/16873/assignments/487876">00. Hello World</a>.</p>
