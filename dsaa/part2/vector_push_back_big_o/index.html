<h2>push_back big-O</h2>
<p>In our <code>push_back</code> code, we only have to create a new array and copy things when the array is full. Even though a single call to <code>push_back</code> is O(n) because it will do O(n) copies, in the worst case, <code>push_back</code> is not always that bad. What's the big-O of calling <code>push_back</code> O(n) times?</p>
<p>To find out, let's look at how many copies are done when we run out of capacity. We know that since we're doubling the array each time, we first resize after 2 elements, 3 elements, 5 elements, 9 elements, 17 elements, 2^k + 1 elements, etc. Here we'll create a table showing the number of elements inserted and count up the number of copies that we have to do per resize and in the last column, we'll sum up the total number of copies done so far:</p>
<table>

<p>The number of copies we have to do is O(n) for single <code>push_back</code> because we might have to copy the n elements we've inserted so far... but it's also O(n) to call <code>push_back</code> n times. So, if you divide the big-O of doing the operation n times by n, we get that <code>push_back</code> is <strong>amortized</strong> O(n) / n = O(1).</p>
<h2>Timing It</h2>
<p>Let's see if the theory holds up. Here we'll add an <code>ops_counter</code> to our <code>TemplateVector::push_back</code> to see if it actually scales like we expect <em>and</em> we'll run a timer to see the actual time and plot them both on a graph to see how the real running time lines up with all the operations we're counting.  </p>
